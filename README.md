# Conding-Challenges
The conding train's coding challenges with my twist put on them

The idea of this repository is to learn some things using the ideas from the coding train's coding challenge, and improve on them. Later I'll clarify all the "rules".
I'll try to make almost all of them (if Daniel chose them there's a reason) and I'll try to make them as quickly as possible (The repo New-Things/Proyects will have more advanced proyects).
If there's one proyect I really like or if I have a big idea I'll make a bigger proyect and put it in New-Things/Proyects

Rules:
  1) The code can't do the same as Daniel's, it has to have a different description, his should be an inspiration
  2) I have to do at least 3 of them per week
  3) At least once per month I have to make a "big" proyect and use 1-2 weeks in it (doesnt have to be from the conding challenges)
  4) It doesn't have to be in order. I can (and probably will) use coding challenges to prepare for a big proyect
